        &emsp;Vs code debugger allows you to step through code line by line. In

This will create two configurations for launching the VSCode debugger. One to test individual Node.js files called
"Launch", and one to test projects with mocha set up called "Mocha Tests"

        JSON has similar syntax of a JavaScript object but one of the main differences is that all the keys must be wrapped in
        double quotations.

<h2 tabindex="1">Project Instructions</h2>
<p>
    In this phase, you'll be using the VSCode debugger to debug the problems in the problems folder.
</p>
<p>
    Go through each file one by one to debug all the errors. There could be multiple errors in one file, so make sure that
    the code behaves as you expect before moving onto the next file.
</p>
<p>
    Instead of using console.log to debug, make sure to use the debugger.
</p>
<p>
    If you spot the error before using the debugger, make sure to validate the solution to the error by placing an
    appropriate debugger, running it, and explaining to your partner that whatever the debugger exposes supports your
    solution. Do not fix the error until you do this exercise.
</p>
<p>
    Start debugging!
