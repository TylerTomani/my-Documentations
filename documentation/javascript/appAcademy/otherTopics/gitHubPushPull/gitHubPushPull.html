    <h1>Pushing and Pulling command line github</h1>
        <h2>GitHub Repository</h2>
            <p>
                A Github repository is used to store a project remotely, in the cloud. <br>
                A repo can contain folders and any type of files that are related to your project. <br>
                Once you clone a repo you can run the
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>command git status</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                to see what branch you are working on. <br>
                If it is a new repo it might be on the master branch unless your project has renamed the designated branches.  <br>
                It is important to keep track of which branch you are working on so there aren't merge conflicts when you start to combine different branches.
            </p>

        <h2>Local Branch</h2>
            <p>
                Usually, when you are working on a project you want to make a new branch and give it a detailed name with the command,
            </p>
            <p>
                <code> git checkout -b "your branch name"</code>.
            </p>
                All your work will be done in your local branch just in case an unexpected bug appears and breaks all of your work. Since it is stored locally it doesn't affect the repo yet and all the previous code before the bug will still work.
                Once you finish working in your branch, you want to save your work by committing. The syntax is, <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <code> git add . </code> <br>
                &emsp;and, <br>
                <code>git commit -m "your note here"</code>
            </p>
                when the commit is complete it saves all your work on your local branch. It is helpful to commit changes after completing work on a small feature or addressing a bug. It is also important to make your commit message as meaningful as possible, to describe the exact change that you are committing to your local branch.
            </p>
        <h2>Pushing to your Repo</h2>
        <p>
            After you have finished adding the changes and saving the commit, all your code and work are still on your local branch. To apply those additions or changes to the repo in Github, you have to push your work up into the repo, open a pull request, and then merge it.
        </p>
        <p>
            To push up your work the syntax is,
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>git push origin "your branch name"</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, go to your Github repo and do a pull request. The pull request should be reviewed by someone just to make sure everything looks good and there are no merge conflicts before you merge your work. Finally, after the pull request is reviewed and there are no merge conflicts then you can safely merge your work into the main branch of your repo.
        </p>
        <p>
            But wait, on your local device your work is still only on your branch. This is when you want to go back to the main branch using the git command
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>git checkout "main branch name here"</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Being back on your main branch you don't see your work. That is because you need to do a pull to make sure your main branch is the most up-to-date. This is done by running the git command,
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>git pull origin "main branch name here"</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, when your local device has been updated you should be able to see all the work you made in the repo.
        </p>
