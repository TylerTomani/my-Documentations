    <h1 tabindex="1">The Callstack</h1>

    <p tabindex="1">
        &emsp;Javascript is a <q>single threaded</q> language meaning it can only execute a single line of code
        at a time.
        <br>
        The call is a structure that keeps track of functions calls by using a
        <i>stack data structure</i>. In computer science a <q>stack</q> is  general pattern
        that keep a collection of items.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>new items must be placed on top of the pile - we refer to this as pushing a new item to the stack</li>
        <li>at any point, the only item that can be removed is the top of the pile - we refer to this as popping the top item from
        the stack</li>
    </ul>
    <p tabindex="1">
        &emsp;Stack frames are the items that are pushed and poopped in the stack. When an function is called,
        it is pushed onto the stack. Once the function returns, the frame on the the stack is pooped off

    <h3>Important Notes</h3>
    <p tabindex="1">
        In the example program we just traced through, we mentioned that the program will exit once the call stack is empty.
        This is not true of all programs. If a program is asynchronously listening for an event to occur, such as waiting
        for a
        setTimeout to expire, then the program will not exit. In this scenario, once the setTimeout timer expires, a stack
        frame
        corresponding to the setTimeout callback will be added to the stack. From here, the call stack would be processed in
        the
        way we previously explored. Imagine that we had the same functions as before, but we called foo asynchronously:
    </p>

    <script>
        let foo = function(){
            console.log("A");
            bar();
            console.log("E");
        }
        let bar = function(){
            console.log("bar : B");
            baz();
            console.log("bar : D");
        }
        let baz = function(){
            console.log("baz : C")
        }
        foo();
    </script>
