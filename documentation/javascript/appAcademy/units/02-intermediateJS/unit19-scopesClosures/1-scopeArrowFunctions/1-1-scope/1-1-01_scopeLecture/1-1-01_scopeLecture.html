            &emsp;A huge advantage for using scope is <strong>Security</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            - Scope adds security to our code by ensuring that variables can only be accessed by pre-defined parts of our
            programs.

    <h3>Lexical Scope</h3>
    <div tabindex="1">
        <p>
            &emsp;Before code runs, it is parsed. This is known as <q>Lexing time</q>. n the lexing time your parser
            resolves variable names to their values when functions are nested.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;The main take away is that lexical scope is determined at lexing time so we can determine the values of variables
            without having to run any code. JavaScript is a language without dynamic scoping. This means that by looking at a piece
            of code we can determine the values of variables just by looking at the different scopes involved.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div tabindex="1">
        <pre>
            function outer() {
            let x = 5;

            function inner() {
            // here we know the value of x because scope chaining will
            // go into the scope above this one looking for variable named x.
            // We do not need to run this code in order to determine the value of x!
            console.log(x);
            }
            inner();
            }
        </pre>
        <p>

            In the inner function above we don't need to run the outer function to know what the value of x will be because of
            lexical scoping.
